                                              types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                              any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                              objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                              all values, and generates an error if
                                              a disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)
                                              Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.

                                      two important differences between DataSource
                                      and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                      two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Alpha) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                    the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted
                                    together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will
                                    be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>`
                                    is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry.
                                    Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated
                                    name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too
                                    long). \n An existing PVC with that name that
                                    is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for
                                    the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by
                                    mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created
                                    PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has
                                    to updated with an owner reference to the pod
                                    once the pod exists. Normally this should not
                                    be necessary, but it may be useful when manually

                                            of objects, DataSourceRef   allows any

                                            all values, and generates an error if
                                            a disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)

                                            of objects, DataSourceRef   allows any
                                            non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                            objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                            values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                            all values, and generates an error if
                                            a disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)

                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes`
                                      array entry. Pod validation will reject the
                                      pod if the concatenated name is not valid for
                                      a PVC (for example, too long). \n An existing
                                      PVC with that name that is not owned by the
                                      pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid
                                      using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting
                                      the pod is then blocked until the unrelated
                                      PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to
                                      updated with an owner reference to the pod once
                                      the pod exists. Normally this should not be
                                      necessary, but it may be useful when manually
                                      reconstructing a broken cluster. \n This field

                                              types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                              any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                              objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                              all values, and generates an error if
                                              a disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)

                              before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed.
                              \n Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the
                              pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring
                              from snapshot or capacity    tracking are needed, c)
                              the storage driver is specified through a storage class,
                              and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning
                              through    a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource
                              for more    information on the connection between this
                              volume type    and PersistentVolumeClaim). \n Use PersistentVolumeClaim
                              or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that
                              persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual
                              pod. \n Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes
                              if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see
                              the documentation of the driver for more information.
                              \n A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time."

                                  validation will reject the pod if the concatenated

                                  not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually

                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:

                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                          any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)
                                          Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                          When this field is specified, volume binding

                                          or dynamic provisioner. This field will
                                          replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                          field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                          they must have the same value. For backwards

                                          DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                          automatically if one of them is empty and
                                          the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                          any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)

                                          object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding
                                          will only succeed if the type of the specified
                                          object matches some installed volume populator
                                          or dynamic provisioner. This field will
                                          replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                          field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                          they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                          DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                          automatically if one of them is empty and
                                          the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                          any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is   specified. (Alpha)
                                          Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                          all values, and generates an error if a
